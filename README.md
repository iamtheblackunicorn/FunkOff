*An over-powered engine to evaluate mathematical graph functions.* :chart_with_upwards_trend:

## About :books:

The other day I wanted to compute a number of values for a function formula. I wondered how I could implement a function that handles cubes, squares and linear functions fed into a code function as a string and produce a list of values as Ys from a given list of Xs. *Funk Off* is that library. It supports linear functions, quadratic functions, and cubic functions!
